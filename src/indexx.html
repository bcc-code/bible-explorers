                <p>Gina is having a tough day at school. Everyone seems to be looking forward to high school, except for Gina. She’s dreading it. Really dreading it. Jack suggests that they visit their secret headquarters – where they can get answers to all their questions. But Gina isn’t so sure. Is there even a solution to dreading something or being afraid?</p>
                <p>In this chapter, the children will hear the Bible verse “Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.” What does that mean? And can it be of practical help for the children? We travel back to the time when the hero of faith Daniel was alive and experience what happened when the king passed a law that forbade anyone from praying to anybody except the king himself for 30 days. What can the children learn from Daniel?</p>
